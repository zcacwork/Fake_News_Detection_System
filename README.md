# Fake_News_Detection_System
A Machine Learning-based NLP project that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using text classification techniques. The system processes news headlines and article content, converts textual data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, and trains a Logistic Regression model to detect misinformation.

**Features**
Preprocesses news headlines and article text
Removes punctuation, URLs, numbers, and unwanted text
Converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
Trains a binary classification model
Predicts whether a news article is fake or real
Allows real-time custom text testing through user input


**Tech Stack**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Machine Learning Workflow
Data Collection using Fake and Real News datasets
Data Cleaning and Text Preprocessing
Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
Model Training using Logistic Regression
Model Evaluation using Accuracy and Classification Report
Real-time Prediction on custom news input


**Dataset:**
The project uses the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle containing thousands of labeled news articles for training and testing.

**Run Process**
Type in terminal:python Brain.py

**Expected Output**
Fake News Samples: (23481, 4)
True News Samples: (21417, 4)
Combined Dataset Shape: (44898, 5)
Accuracy: 0.98

Enter news headline/article:
NASA confirms aliens landed in New York yesterday

Prediction: Fake News.


**Results**
Achieved high classification accuracy in detecting fake vs real news articles and demonstrated practical application of NLP in misinformation detection.


**Future Improvements**
